# hello! welcome to my goofy ahh project i made
# it is quite simple but it took me a while to make
# i hope you like it!
# best played at %80 zoom
# dont look at the source code
#
#
#   changelog
# --------------
# ver 0.1.4 alpha
# - finished rough outline and tweaked the code 
# - added changelog
# 
# ver 0.2.0 beta
# - overhauled the ui
# - added a lot of new features
# - added a lot of new commands
# - replaced 'connect$' with '~/terminal$'
# - fixed 'error 1' bug
# - secrets 
# - the wall of nothing
# - .dev
# ver 0.2.1 beta
# - made error 1 'nicer' then quickly changed it back
# - fixed case sensitive commands with the help of Mike
# - added '2004_earthquake'
# ver 0.2.2 beta
# - added 'comments' dont look at the code!
# - failed base64
# - users
# - who actualy looks at this?
